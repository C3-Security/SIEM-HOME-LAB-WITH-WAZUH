# Setting up a SIEM Home lab using Wazuh
This project will be providing you with the necessary steps that I did to configure a Security Information &amp; Event (SIEM) home lab using Wazuh. Wazuh is a FREE open-source security platform that provides both XDR & SIEM protection. We'll be using Wazuh to monitor, detect, alert, & respond to threats generated by our virtual machines. While other tools such as Splunk are favored by most companies, Wazuh is completely free which is perfect for small businesses & home projects.

The purpose of this project is to acquire hands-on experience of using a XDR & SIEM tool to detect, analyze, & respond to threats that we'll be generating using Kali Linux & Windows. The great thing about this project is that we'll be able to gain experience in the realm of the Red Team & Blue Team since we'll be attacking our own network using Kali Linux due to vulnerabilities on the Windows OS & then using Wazuh to detect, analyze, & respond to those generated threats. 

# Environments Used
- Ubuntu 22.04 as the server for Wazuh
- Windows & Linux as endpoint machines

# Configuring Wazuh on Ubuntu
In this project, we'll be using Ubuntu 22.04 as the server for Wazuh. If you don't already have a Ubuntu VM, you can check out the following youtube guides to set one up.
*insert youtube links*

Once you have your Ubuntu VM launched, we'll start by installing Wazuh.
You can follow this link for official documentation for Wazuh for installation: https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/quickstart.html

On the Ubuntu VM, we'll run the Wazuh installation assistant by opening Terminal and using the following command:
```
curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/4.7/wazuh-install.sh && sudo bash ./wazuh-install.sh -a
```
Once you run that command, it should begin the installation of Wazuh and then provide you with the username, password, and web interface link to login.
 *(Installation may take around 5-10 minutes so try to be patient)*
